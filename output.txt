yes:
Many laugh; and the somber mood the 36-year-old Waller had sensed before
beginning his speech seems to have lightened up.
But he hits a
snag about halfway through his speech when he asks the audi-
ence some questions It' $ a
technique he has used successfully in the U.S. in order
to
to know the audience: It fails in Japan:
[B]
~Nobody raised
their hands;" he
says:
~It really surprised
me
at  first.
Now,
when I see that happening; I Il change the tone of my voice to
them to respond:
But I don't always succeed:
Waller did what most American professional speech trainers advise against by
joking with
a
Japanese business audience. But he is an accomplished speaker and
managed to carry it off.
Humor often doesn 't translate into another language, experts say, and cultural
references that are often used in jokes are usually lost
the listeners Instead, for-
eign speakers in Japan are advised to be spontaneous, speak from the heart or tell
a
personal story that is relevant to the speech:
[C]
Kristina Gibbs, president of a Tokyo-based market-research firm; tells the story
of her business partner aS an example
~He
was an excellent teller of jokes and stories;'
she says "He translated two
jokes into Japanese with the help of Japanese friends He practiced
to the point
where he told them flawlessly. But when he gave the jokes; the Japanese audience
didn 't understand anything: It was doubtful whether they even knew it was a joke
or not'
The typical Japanese speech doesn't begin with a joke as it might in the US
Instead,
a
Japanese speech is usually begun with
an
apology, such as "Im not the
expert;'
Tm not good enough to be here;'
~The other guy is not here; "
or V[m so
young and unworthy:'
[D] This practice is diametrically opposed to U.S. business culture, in which ex-
ecutives cannot advance unless they are very good speakers
